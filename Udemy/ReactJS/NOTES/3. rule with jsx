you can only have one root element

example:
return (
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
) => this will fail

return (
    <div>
        <div className='ex'> test1 </div>
        <div> test2 </div>
    </div>
) => this is the right way

why? because this is actually a simplified version of returning jsx code
before you have to do it like this

return React.createElement(
    'div',
    {},
    React.createElement ('div', {className='ex'}, test1),
    React.createElement ('div', {}, test2),
)

1st argument is the root 
2nd is the attribute of the root
3rd and so on is the child element of the root

thats why you can have more than 1 root element, that would mean you want to return more than
1 thing, example:
return React.createElement(React.createElement(
    'div',
    {},),  React.createElement ('div', {className='ex'}, test1),
    
and you cannot return more than one thing
