react main task is to render UI and react to user input

so the effect of react is to:
1. evaluate and render jsx
2. manage state and props
3. react to user input and events
4. re-evaluate component upon state and props changes

whats called side-effect in react is everything but the effect itself
so storing data to browser storage, sending http request to backend server, set & manage timers
is not really react's main job so you need different way to handle it

you have to remember that a component is basically a function
and it will be re-executed everytime theres any changes in the state 

if you have a http request on your component that also using state in it 
the http request will be executed everytime the state changes and this is not a good practice

we use something called useEffect() to handle these side effects
