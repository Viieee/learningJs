jsx has some limitations, we already discussed it in the basics section
one big limitation that jsx has is it has to return one root element on each component
one common workaround for this limitation is to put the content of the component on div

it can create some problem in readability side of the code
where it can create a bunch of divs and make a 'div soup'

theres a few way to solve this, 
1. create custom wrapper component

const Wrapper = props => {
  return props.children;
};

export default Wrapper;

the wrapper will contain the children nested inside of it and later on won't be shown in 
    the code view

2. using fragment 
<React.Fragment>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
      <ChildC />
    </React.Fragment>

or 

<>
    <ChildA />
    <ChildB />
    <ChildC />
</>
