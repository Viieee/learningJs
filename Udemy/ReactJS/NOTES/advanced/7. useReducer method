useReducer is an alternative to useState, the use case of useReducer is:
1. when managing some complex states
2. managing multiple state
when you updating state depending on another state

const [state, dispatchFunction] = useReducer(reducerFunction, initialState, initFunction)

reducer function example
function emailReducer(state, action){

  // initial state
  return {value: '', isValid: false}
}


the reducer function will get the latest snapshot of the state and the action that triggered
    the reducer function execution
    and it should return new updated state

value passed as argument in dispatchFunction will be stored in action parameter on reducerFunction
