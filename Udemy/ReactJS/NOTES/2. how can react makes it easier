react can make it easier for developer that want to manipulate dom by using jsx 

jsx is an xml/html like syntax used by react,
it allows react to transform an imperative approach with vanilla javascript
example:
const p = document.createElement('p')
p.textContent = 'this is a paragraph'
document.getElementById('root').append(p)

into 
file 1 (App.js)
function App(){
    return(
        // ! this is called the end state
        <div>
            <h2>lets get started!</h2>
            <p>this is a paragraph</p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default App;
file 2 (index.js)
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
// ! the <App /> inside render file is also a jsx syntax

jsx syntax allows react developer to express an end state of the component that they want 
to make, and allowing developers to write it in a language that is already familiar to them
which is html.
later on in the browser react and jsx will transform the html like code (which is normally not allowed by the browser)
into a language that the browser can understand
