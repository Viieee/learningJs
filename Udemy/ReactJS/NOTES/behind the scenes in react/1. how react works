react main job is to manage state and manage components 

the one part of react that actually managing the dom (the interface user sees) is react dom

react will manage the state, if the state changes on a certain components 
    react will re-evaluate the component and comparing the previous snapshot of the
    component and the new one after state changed, 
    if theres any changes in the component react will tell react dom 
    the changes made in the specific component so later on 
    react can make the changes on the dom

react will 're-evaluate'/re-executing the component function 
    everytime the props, context, and the state changes 
    this doesn't mean react will re-render the component though
    react will only tell react dom to re-render the component
    if its necesarry
