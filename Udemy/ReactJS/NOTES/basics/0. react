react js is a javascript library that focused on the UI of an application 
    it is a client side javascript and help to make UI more modern and reactive
    and feel like a mobile app and make it easier for the developers

with vanila javascript, you definitly can manipulate the DOM but you need to 
    do small operations like creating the element, setting the content of it, etc
    per element that you want to see on the screen. 
    In other words you doing some repetitive things if you develop front end 
    with just vanilla javascript.
