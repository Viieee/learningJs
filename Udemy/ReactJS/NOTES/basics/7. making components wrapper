you can make your custom component as a wrapper for another elements
example:
**** we have a component called 'cards' ****
import Card from './Card';
function ExpenseItem(props) {
  return (
    <Card className="expense-item">
      <ExpenseDate date={props.date}/>
    </Card>
  );
}

normally you can't do this but you can do it by setting the returned value of the card component
## in cards component ##
function Card(props){
    return <div className='card'>{props.children}</div>
}

props.childer will let you wrap any element around the custom component
