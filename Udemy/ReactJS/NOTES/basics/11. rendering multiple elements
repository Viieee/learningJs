you can render multiple element by looping through an array and returning a single element using map
becuase if you try to render array of elements, react will render it side by side (as siblings node)
example:
const contoh = ['satu', 'dua', 'tiga']

return (
    <>
        {contoh.map(item=>(
            <li key={item}>{item}</li>
        ))}
    </>
)

note that you wrapped the loop in () and not {},
if you wrapped it in {} you need to return it again and its actually okay

key is something you need to set on your mapped out elements, because in this operation
we try to render a collection inside a components.

key is something react use to identify each individual component, so later on when state is used
react doesn't need to re render the whole component, but only the one updated and needed to be 
re-rendered
