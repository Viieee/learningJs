we can communicate and passing data from children to parent with the help of props too!
we do it by passing function into child element, this function from parent can be triggered
    in the children element. And this function execution is the way to pass data from 
    children element to parent element.
    By adding parameter to the function passed from parent, parent can recieve data
    through initalization of the function called with the help of props!

example:
**** NewExpense.js (parent component) ****
const NewExpense = (props) => {
  const saveExpenseDataHandler = (enteredExpenseData) => {
    console.log(enteredExpenseData)
  };

  return (
    <div className='new-expense'>
      <ExpenseForm onSaveExpenseData={saveExpenseDataHandler} />
    </div>
  );
};

**** ExpenseForm.js (child component) ****
const ExpenseForm = (props) => {
    const expenseData = {
      title: 'title test',
      amount: 1,
      date: new Date(2020,2,3),
    };
  const submitHandler = (event) => {
    props.onSaveExpenseData(expenseData);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={submitHandler}/>
  );
};

the data logged in saveExpenseDataHanlder function in NewExpense component is the expenseData
in ExpenseForm
