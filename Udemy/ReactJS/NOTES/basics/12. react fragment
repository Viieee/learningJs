because of the jsx rule (look number #3), you need to wrapped the returned elements, 
you dont need to wrapped it around div you can just wrapped it around whats called react fragment. 
why?
because react components used to be wrapped only with div, this will create whats called 'div soup'
where the nested div is so long.
example on react fragment vs div:
*** using div ***
return (
    <div>
        <h2></h2>
        <p></p>
    </div>
)

*** using react fragment ***
return(
    <>
        <h2></h2>
        <p></p>
    </>
)
