you can normally just use the components you already make 
but its not that simple for the data 
you need to use jsx feature called 'props'
props is an object that will contain all the value of attribute passed onto the components
it is very similar to parameter-argument in function

example:
*** WE HAVE A COMPONENT CALLED 'ITEM' ***
<Item 
    title={expenses[0].title}
    amount={expenses[0].amount}
    date={expenses[0].date}>
</Item>

props is a key-value pair 
title, amount, and date is the key to be accessed on props
later on it can be accesed like props.title, props.amount, props.date on the component itself

you can shorten the code further with:
<Item 
    title={expenses[0].title}
    amount={expenses[0].amount}
    date={expenses[0].date} />

if theres no content inside of the custom tags
