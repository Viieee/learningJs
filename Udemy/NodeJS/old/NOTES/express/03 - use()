use() allows us to add a new middleware function
you can pass a function into it as the argument 
and the function argument will be executed for
every incoming request

the function argument will take 3 argument,
1st argument is request 
2nd argument is response
3rd argument is next, is another function that will be passed onto this function argument
                      this argument is important if you don't want to send a response in
                      this argument function for the use() method

example:

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('In the middleware!');
    next(); // Allows the request to continue to the next middleware in line
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('In another middleware!');
    res.send('<h1>Hello from Express!</h1>');
});
