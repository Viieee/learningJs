session is a place in the backend where we can store some information

it does not mean that we store it in the request, 
    because the value will be gone if we accessing different request
it does not mean that we store it in variable either, 
    because that will be shared across all users

we only want to share the information across all request of the same user
for that we need to store it on the server

then we will use cookie to store the id of the session
yes the user can still change it and assume different id but that will not work,
    because the value you store will not be the id but the hashed id so the server
    is the only one that can confirm that it has not been fiddled with so that 
    user don't play around with it

we need a third party package for using session
npm install --save express-session
