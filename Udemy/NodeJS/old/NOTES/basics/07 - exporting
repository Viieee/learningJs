there are a few ways for a developer to export something on their code in node,

1st way
module.exports = requestHandler;

2nd way
if you exporting multiple things
module.exports = {
    handler: requestHandler,
    someText: 'Some hard coded text'
};

3rd way
module.exports.handler = requestHandler;
module.exports.someText = 'Some text';

4th way
exports.handler = requestHandler;
exports.someText = 'Some hard coded text';
