instead of having relations and strong schemas, NoSQL has other focuses

in NoSQL we call tables 'collections'

inside of collections we can find the data, but we don't call it records 
    we call it documents and it resembles javascript object

in NoSQL we can have documents that dont follow any sort of scehmas/rules
example:

    inside 1 collections called users we can have 2 different documents that
    have different data inside of it,
    1st data can contain the name and the age of the uses,
    2nd data cac contain only the name of the user  

so you can store multiple document with different structures in the same collections
    you can definitely store documents which are generally equal but where some fields 
    might differ.

in NoSQL we dont have relations, instead we go for data duplication
