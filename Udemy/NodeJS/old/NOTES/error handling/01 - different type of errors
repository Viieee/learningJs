technical/network errors
    for example: the server is down
    the best way to handle this is to show error page to the user to inform them that there's 
    some problems happening in our end

expected errors
    for example: file can't be read, database operation fails (not expected but CAN HAPPEN!)
    inform the user to (possibly) retry the action 

bugs/logical errors 
    for example: user object used when it doesn't exist
    fix during development


error is thrown 
    synchronous => try catch
    asynchronous => then catch
