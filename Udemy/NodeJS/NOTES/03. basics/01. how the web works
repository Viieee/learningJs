a client visiting a page 
    client entering url
        server is just an ip address
        url is the human-readable version of the server address
    the browser reaches out to some domain name servers to look the domain up
        browser send request to the server with the ip address

            user input validation
            communicating with database
            sending back response to the user
                in the form of some html code, xml/json file
                response and request have headers
                    headers is meta information attached to request/response
    request/response transmission is done through some protocol (http/https)
        these protocols have rules to handle a request and send back a response the browser can work with
        https is http with ssl encryption turned on, so the data that's transmitted is encrypted
