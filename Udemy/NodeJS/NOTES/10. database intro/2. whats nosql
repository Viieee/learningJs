no sql basically means that this database doesn't follow the sql rules

no sql doesn't have strong schemas around it 

so in the same collections(tables), documents(records) we can have different structures
example:
document #1 => {"name": "Vieri", "age": 21}
document #2 => {"name": "Adhit"}

like in sql we can also relate two tables, but in different way of course!
we relate 2 tables with copying the data of the related data into another collections and merged it!
example:

user table:
document #1 => {"id": 1, "name": "Vieri", "age": 21}
document #2 => {"id": 2, "name": "Adhit", "age": 19}

products table:
document #1 => {"id": 1, "name": "table", "price": 100}
document #2 => {"id": 2, "name": "chair", "price": 70}

orders table:
document #1 => {"id": "L90Mj", "user": {"id": 1, "name": "Vieri"}, "product": {"id": 2, "price": 70}}
document #2 => {"id": "K099u", "user": {"id": 2, "name": "Adhit"}, "product": {"id": 1, "price": 100}}
