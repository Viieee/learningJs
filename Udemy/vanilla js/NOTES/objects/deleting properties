let person = {
    aProperty: 'value',
    name: 'Vieri',
    age: 20,
    hobbies: ['gaming', 'coding'],
    greet: function(){
        alert('hi! this alert is called from a method');
    }
}

delete person.age;
or
person.age = undefined;

undefined is different from null
undefined means that the variable has been declared but not defined yet
null is an assigned value (it just means nothing)
