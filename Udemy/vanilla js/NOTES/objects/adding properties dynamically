const person = {
    aProperty: 'value',
    name: 'Vieri',
    age: 20,
    hobbies: ['gaming', 'coding'],
    greet: function(){
        alert('hi! this alert is called from a method');
    }
}

if you want to add new property to your object, just declare it like this
person.isAdmin = true;
isAdmin is the new property in this case

you can also overwrite old value
person.age = 31
the code above will overwrite the age property
