event handler in javascript require you to input 2 parameters
1. what type of event you want to listen to
2. the code that you want to execute when the event is happening wrapped in function

you can create the function separately or write the function in the event listener

important note if you want to create a separate function for your event listener YOU DONT NEED TO PUT () AT THE END OF THE FUNCTION CALLING
example: 
logBtn.addEventListener('click', logHandler);

it's NOT:
logBtn.addEventListener('click', logHandler()); because what it will do is, it will immediatle execute the function when the script is being loaded
                                                and thats not something that you want, is it? you want to execute this function when the event is 
                                                happening not when the script is being loaded.
