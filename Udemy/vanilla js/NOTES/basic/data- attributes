data-something is special attribute you can attach to any element/dom nodes to attach any kind of data to them

every single data- attribute will be stored in 'dataset' in form of DOMStringMap


you can add it dynamically through the dataset, so for example if you want to add an attribute called some info

element.dataset.someInfo = 'data'

it will set new attribute called some info inside that element with 'data' as the value stored in it
