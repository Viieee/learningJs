you can set a timer on some code execution with setTimer() method

it will take 2 argument:
1st argument is a function that will be executed when the timer runs out
2nd argument is the timer length in milisecond

you can execute some code repeatedly every sometime you desire with setInterval()
it takes the same argument as the setTimer() method
with extra 3rd argument being array of argument that can be passed onto the function

because these are methods you can store them in a variable

you can clear/stop timer and interval with
clearInterval() for interval
clearTimeout() for timer/interval 
these methods take the name of the variable containing the setTimer/setInterval methods as the argument.
