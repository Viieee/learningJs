a way to reuse some part of code from one class to another class

example:
you have a function named render() that you use on multiple classes,
you can implement inheritance to shorten the code

if the subclass/ the class that extends from another class doesn't have any constructor
the constructor of the parent class/ the extender is called, use super().

super() method is used to called the parent class constructor through the child class
