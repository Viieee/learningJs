object literals ({}) is great for grouping data and objects
that you only create once, you dont plan on reusing it.
theyre quick and easy to use

classes are great to use if you have some logic to re-use later
and if you re-create the same type of object over and over again.
you can create new object with new data based on the class easier later,
class is holding the structure of the object
