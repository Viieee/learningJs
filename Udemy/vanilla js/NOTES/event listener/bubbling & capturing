bubbling and capturing is the order of event listener execution on surrounding element

bubbling will execute the children's listener first
capturing will execute the parent's listener first

normally addEventListener will implement the bubbling phase
but it can be turned into capturing phase by adding 3rd argunment, and set it to true
