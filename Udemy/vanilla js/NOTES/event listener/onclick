old way of adding events into an element is using onclick
its an attribute on an element in html tags
its also a property, if you want to add an event with it through a js file (recommended way to use it)
if you want to use it as a property, the value added to it has to be a function (anonymous/named)

example:
<button onclick="alert('hi!')">Click me</button>

or

const button = document.querySelector('button')

button.onclick = function(){
    ...
}

or

function buttonFunc(){
    ...
}

button.onclick = buttonFunc;

the difference between this method and the other one is that you cant assigned more than 1 function into an element
so if you want assigned another function that will be executed other than the buttonFunc function,
the second function will be executed instead (overide it)
