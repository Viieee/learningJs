when you have multiple event happening on the same time 
because you have listener on an element and on it's ancestors its called propagation

for example you have a button wrapped inside a div
and both the div and the button have eventListener()
so when you clicked the button, the eventListener in the div will be executed as well
because it's wrapped on it (or it's the ancestor of the button)
that is called propagation

there's instances where you don't want that to happen,
to stop the propagation from happening you can use stopPropagation() method on the event object
