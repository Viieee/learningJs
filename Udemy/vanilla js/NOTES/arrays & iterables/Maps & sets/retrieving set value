you can't retrieve a value on a set with index,
why?
because it doesn't have any index

the only way to retrieve the values is to use for of loop

example:
const ids = [1,2,3]

for(const entry of ids.entries()){
    entry; -> this will return the value on id twice on array each time
              [1,1]
              [2,2]
              [3,3]
    if you don't want this then do this
    entry[0] -> 1
                2
                3
}
