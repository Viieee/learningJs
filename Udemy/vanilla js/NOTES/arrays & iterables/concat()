concat() is used to combine two or more arrays 

the referenced array will be copied and recreated
so if the original array is changed, the new one that's being created with concat() won't be affected

example:
let testArray = [1,2,3,4,5]

let moreArray = [76,98,77]

const brandNewArray = testArray.concat(moreArray) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 76, 98, 77]

testArray.push(8) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
moreArray -> [76, 98, 77]
brandNewArray -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 76, 98, 77]
