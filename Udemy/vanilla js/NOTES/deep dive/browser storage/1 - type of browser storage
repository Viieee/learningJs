theres three type of browser storage:
- localStorage, sessionStorage
- cookies 
- indexedDB

localStorage, sessionStorage
- simple key-value store (simple js object saved in a file)
- manage user preferences or basic user-data
- example of use: 
    - storing session id of a user
    - analytics key
- only js code that runs in the browser can communicate with local storage
- can be cleared by the user via js
- easy to use, quite versatile, bad for complex data

cookies
- simple key-value store (with some config options)
- manage user preferences or basic user-data
- can be cleared by the user via js
- bit clunky to use, quite versatile, sent to server, bad for complex data
- sent to the server with outgoing httpRequests (can also read by the server)

indexedDB
- sophisticated, client-side database
- you can use it with query language
- manage complex data your web app needs
- can access it and clear with js
- bit clunky to use, great for complex (non-critical) data, good performance
