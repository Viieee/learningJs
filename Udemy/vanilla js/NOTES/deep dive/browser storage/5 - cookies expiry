what expiring cookie means, it means the cookie will be deleted at a certain time

default expiry of a cookie is when the session is over (when you close browser) or when 
the browser decided when to delete it

user can also delete the cookies no matter if theres expiration time or not

theres 2 ways you can set an expiry of a cookie:
1. with max-age, takes time in seconds
2. with expires, takes a date with certain format

how?
you set it when you add new cookie
document.cookie = `uid=${userId}; max-age=2` => that means the cookie with the key of uid
                                                will get deleted in 2 seconds

#NOTE
if you have more than one key value in your cookie, if you use the split method
to return it and store it as an array, the key value with expiry date will be deleted after certain time
and if that happens the next value is going up on the order of the index

example:
if you have 2 key value in the cookie with only one key value that has a expiry time
and just happens to be the 1st one on the index/[0], the data in [1] will move to index [0]
and the key value with expiry time will be deleted. if you decided to store it again, it will be store in the back of 
the array/[1]    


this is the reason why retrieving data form a cookie using index array is not the best idea
