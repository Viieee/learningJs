some features might not be able to be worked around with fallback code or with polyfills
example: let, const, async/await, arrow functions

usually the ones that can't be worked around is core language feature

for these features to make it work in older browsers and all the browsers that don't support it
is to use transpilation

the idea behind code transpilation is that you transpile/transform your modern code into 
older code and it's done automatically with the help of a tool
the tool i will be using is babel
