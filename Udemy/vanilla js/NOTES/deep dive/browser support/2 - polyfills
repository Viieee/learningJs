a polyfills is a third party package that adds a functionality which otherwise might be
missing in a browser, it will 'teach' a browser about features in your app that 
don't necessarily supported yet

in other words, polyfills is a work around to replicate a not supported feature with 
existing feature that is supported

not all features will be able to use this method to work on older/non-supporting browsers,
you can look the specific features you want whether it has polyfills support or not 
by searching it on google
