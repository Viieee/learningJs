theres alot of different browsers out there and they don't have the same team that develops them
the team behind browser decides which feature is implemented on their browser. most of the time
the time table of implementation of a feature is different from one browser to the other.

browser feature is different than js syntax

what is browser feature?
browser feature gets implemented individually
whether a certain feature will be implemented or not is decided by the browser team
example: fetch() api, dom api

whats js syntax?
feature that all browser team agreed on to be implemented
implemented in chunks or individually
the implementation is inevitable, maybe one browser takes more time than the other but it WILL be implemented
example: let, const, async/await, Promises


in shorter way of saying it:
not all feature will be implemented in all browser,
but all js syntax will be implemented
