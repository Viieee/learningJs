Typically, data is transferred as "JSON" data between your client-side code and your backend 
("the server").

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and it looks like this:

{
    "name": "Max",
    "age": 30,
    "hobbies": [
        { "id": "h1", "title": "Sports" },
        { "id": "h2", "title": "Cooking" }
    ],
    "isInstructor": true
}
JSON data supports objects ({}), arrays ([]), strings (MUST use double-quotes!), 
numbers (NO quotes) and booleans (also NO quotes).

All object keys (e.g. "name") HAVE to be wrapped by double quotes. 
No quotes or single quotes are NOT ALLOWED!

Actually, the whole JSON "object" is wrapped in quotes itself because JSON data in the 
end is just a string that contains data in the format shown above.


Also nice to know: You're NOT LIMITED to objects when converting data to JSON. 
You can also convert numbers, arrays, booleans or just strings - all data types JSON supports:

const jsonNumber = JSON.stringify(2); // "2"
const jsonText = JSON.stringify('Hi there! I use single quotes in raw JS'); // ""Hi there! ...""
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]); // "[1,2,3]"
const jsonBoolean = JSON.stringify(true); // "true"

object/string/boolean/arrays/number to JSON ==> JSON.stringify(object/string/boolean/arrays/number)
JSON to object/string/boolean/arrays/number (normal js data) ==> JSON.parse(JSONdata)
