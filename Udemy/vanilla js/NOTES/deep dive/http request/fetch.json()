fetch.json() is a method available in fetch api
the main usage of it is to convert the data 
fetched from the fetch api 

why?
because the data returned from the fetch api is a streamed data
and it's not possible to work with it without converting it first

this is the flow
fetch() => return a streamed data
streamed data is being converted by fetch.json() => json data
json data is being converted by fetch.json() => js objects/arrays
