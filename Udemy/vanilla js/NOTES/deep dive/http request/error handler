in handling error, we can use onerror() method on the XMLHttpRequest object
this method will be executed if the network on the client side fails
or in other words the request is failed to be sent/time out 

example:
xhr.onerror = function(){
    // if we fail to send the request
    // e.g network failure
    reject(new Error('Something went wrong!'));
}


other than the network failure, the request technically still being sent successfully

in other case of error that can happen on the process of writing the code
you need to check on the onload() method if the status property of the http request object 
is around 200-300 (which indicates successful request) and not above that (e.g 404)

example:

xhr.onload = function(){

    // checking the status of the request
    if(xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300){
        resolve(xhr.response);
    }else{
        reject(new Error('Something went wrong!'));
    }
}
