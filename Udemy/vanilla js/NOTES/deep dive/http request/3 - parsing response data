we can parse the data we get from the server using the .response property on the XMLHttpRequest object

example:
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

xhr.response -> this line will parse the response from the request

note that the data type of the response is JSON type and 
therefore need to be converted first before able to be processed
