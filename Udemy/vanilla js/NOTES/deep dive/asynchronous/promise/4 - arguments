promise take function as argument, and the argument function is taking 2 argument (in form of dfault function)

example :
const posPromise = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{

});

in above example posPromise is a promise that takes an anonymous function as the argument

and the anonymous function in the Promise's argument is taking 2 argument itself
those 2 are a default function argument made for Promise objects
