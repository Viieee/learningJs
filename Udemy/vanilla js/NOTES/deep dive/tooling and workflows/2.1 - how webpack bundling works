webpack needs to know where the entry point in our code is, and by that 
i mean the js code we will be importing directly from the html file

after that it will analyze the entry point file resolve the dependencies (file imports)
inside of the file and it will then go into our dependency files and resolve the
dependency of our dependencies and so on.
