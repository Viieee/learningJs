ideally we want to have two different workflows which we can start
- development workflow, which should start whenever we save changes to our code
    we want to have linting set up (ESLint)
    we want to bundle our code (webpack)
    we want to have a development server that automatically reloads whenever changes made
- production workflow, which you want to start with a certain command (you want to run it when the code is ready)
    we want to have linting set up (ESLint)
    we want to bundle our code (webpack)
    we want to compile our code, to translate it from modern js into js that can run in older
        browser as well (babel)
    we want to optimize the code
    we want to have production ready code
