1. run command npm install --save-dev webpack@4 --save-exact
2. run command npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
3. to use webpack we create config file, called webpack.config.js, this file 
    will be the configuration of the webpack you will be using. it will be executed
    by nodeJs in the backrgound
4. on the file we make a new object with the name of module.exports;
    example:
    module.exports = {

    }
    the object above is the syntax used by nodeJs to expose the object outside of the file
    and webpack tool will import that object.
5. we need to re-structure the files first in our project, we need to have 1 folder for the entry
    and 1 folder as an output source, the output source will be directly connected to the 
    html file, in the case of our project in the module 21 folder we will use src folder as the entry folder
    and the scripts folder inside the assets folder as the output source
6. basic setup for entry and output webpack :

const path = require('path'); // path package

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/app.js', // path to the entry point from this file (webpack.config.js)
    output: { // configuring all about the output of the bundling process
        filename: 'app.js', // name of the file we will be generating using the bundling process
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'assets', 'scripts') // path of the targeted folder

    }
};

7. we need to edit some things in the script property in package.json file, you can basically setup
    custom script that you can run later through the command line
    example:
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "build": "webpack"
    }

    now you can run npm run build on your ide terminal and webpack will run
