npm install --save-dev webpack@4 --save-exact

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli       

then make a config file with the name webpack.config.js in the same folder as eslintrc.json
this file will be executed by nodeJs in the background

webpack needs to know the starting point of your app/it needs to know where in your source files
the entry point of your project is (in our previous project it will be the app.js file)
then it will analyse the file and analyse the import/dependencies of this file (app.js file)
and resolving all the dependencies of that file and the files related to that file

webpack will look into the app.js file because it's the 'entry point' of the project
then it will look into what files do the app.js needs in order to fully function (the imports/dependencies)
and it will see that the app.js file is importing the ProjectList.js file
then webpack will do the same thing to the ProjectList.js file as it did to the app.js file
