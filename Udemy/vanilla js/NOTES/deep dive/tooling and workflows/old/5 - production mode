make a new webpack config file and name it differently. example:webpack.config.prod.js

copy the config file content and store it in the new webpack config file
change the mode property into production
and change the devtool into production ready devtool (read it on documentation)


make new script on package.json and refer to the new config file
example:
"build:prod": "webpack --config webpack.config.prod.js"
