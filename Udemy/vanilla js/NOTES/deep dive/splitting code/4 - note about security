we want to prevent our code from downloading some malicious file
you might be asking yourself, 'wdym? why would i add those features into my app'
well if you use some type of library, those library might be compromised and 
those library might be the one that tries to download some malicious files

thats why in order to implement this method of using modules 
you need to served the web on a real server

the quick solution is to use serve.js or 
install apache server on your device
