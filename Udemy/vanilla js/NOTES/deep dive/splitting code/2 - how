we need to 'unlock' it first
how?
we need to add a special keyword that makes it clear that we want to exporting the file and makes it available 
for the other file to import

that keyword is 'export'
example:
export class someClass{

}

you can also export functions, variables, constant and so on by exposing it first with export keyword.

because when we use the traditional script importing method (in the html file)
the entire code in the file will be globally available

but if we dont do that it bassically locked from the outside and won't be globally available

after we use the export key on the class,
we have to import the file to the respective files we need the files in

importing file use relative path to the importing file

./ same folder
../ up 1 folder

example:
import from './Component.js'

its still cause an error,
because you only selected the file name
and when you importing a file you need to specify what you want to import from the particular file
insert it in {} after the import keyword and before the from keyword
example:
import {Component} from './Component.js'
