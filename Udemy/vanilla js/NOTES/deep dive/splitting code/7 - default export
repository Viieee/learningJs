you can import and export something as a default by adding the syntax 'export default' on the object that you want to export and import
when you do this you can even omit the object name

there can only be ONE default export object on each file

example:
from 
export class classA{

}

to
export default class {

}

if you importing the dependency like this you can import it like
import cmp from './someFile.js' // cmp is the name that will represent the default object 
                                // because you don't wrap it in {}
                                // you can change the name with anything you want

this syntax only works when the imported file has a default export

the disadvantage is the naming could be a problem if you work on a team

what if theres more than the default export on the same file that you want to import
then you do this

import cmp,{someClass} from './someFile.js'
