what's starting point?
it's a file that connects the html file to the js file 
while it's true that js files can point into each other
you still need one file to 'bridge' the js and the html file

the difference between importing a starting point file and importing regular js file in html is
that you need to add 'type=modular' attribute after the defer keyword

this will informs the browser that this starting point script and every js script referenced by it 
will use modules

YOU NEED THIS METHOD ON EVERY SINGLE SCRIPT THAT REQUIRES POINTING INTO ANOTHER FILES
