module in js is used to simplifying spliting code

how?
well while it's true you can split your code in js
but what if a class in file 'a' needs to extend a class in file 'b'
your answer might be, 'oh just import it sequentially on the html script import'
while that's true and is definitely doable in smaller projects
it can be a hell to figure out which file needs which file and therefore
need to be imported first

that's where the modules come in and make the process easier
