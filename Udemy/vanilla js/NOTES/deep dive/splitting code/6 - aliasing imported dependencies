you can change the name of the class/function/variables that you imported with the as syntax

why?
maybe for some cases where you want to avoid any name class on one file you can use this method

example
import {classA as newClassA} from './someFile.js';

so everytime you want to refer and use classA you use newClassA as the name instead
this method doesn't change the file name entirely, it only change the name for the file importing it that way
