we want to split our code to keep the code maintanable and to make it easier to work on 
so if you working on a team it's easier to assign a member of your team to work on 
specific part of your project rather than the whole team working on 1 huge file
containing all the logic behind the project. Even if it's possible to do, it's not something 
that recommended by a lot of vets (to avoid some misunderstanding and accident on writing the code)

another benefit of spliting the code is you can find stuff quicker
for example if you want to find a logic that calculates things on your project
on 1 huge file style of managing the code, it can take awhile to find the line of logic you're lookin for
but if you split the code and name the file with the specific function of the code inside of the file
you'll find it easier and quicker.
