you can import more than one thing from different file and from the same file
if you want to import more than 1 thing from 1 class you can do it like this example:

import {function,class} from './someFile.js';

or you can import the whole file in a bundle with a special syntax '* as bundleName'
example:

you have a file with class and function in file a and you want to import all of them to file b 
file a:
class a{
    aFunction(){

    }
}

function bFunc(){

}

function cFunc(){

}

file b:
import * as bundle from './fileA.js'

// accessing the things
// aFunction
const aFunc = bundle.a.aFunction()
//bFunc 
const bFunc = bundle.bFunc()
//cFunc 
const cFunc = bundle.cFunc()
