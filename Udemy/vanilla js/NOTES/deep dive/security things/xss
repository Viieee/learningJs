dont use innerHtml, but use textContent instead if we want to inject a text dynamically

or sanitize the innerHtml, that means you need to strip away any potential script 
type input from user and 'clean it'

you can use a package called sanitize-html, that is a server side sanitizer.
And it will sanitize user input before you store the data into the database

xss also works if you trying to store something in your database   
you also need to make sure that all third party packages youre using on your projects is
protected and up-to-date
