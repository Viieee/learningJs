you can create a server in node js using the createServer method from http object
it will return a Server object so you need to store it in a variable
so you can use something with it

the method will take a function and this function will be executed for every
incoming request

and the function will take 2 arguments, 
1st argument represent the incoming request
2nd argument represent the response that can be returned

example:
const http = require('http');

function rqListener(req, res){
    console.log(req);
}

const server = http.createServer(rqListener);

on the createServer method, you don't use () in the argument function because you don't want
the function to be executed once when the script is loaded (like function event handler)
