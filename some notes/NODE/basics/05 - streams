streams is basically an ongoing process,
the request is simply read by node in chunks/multiple parts

why?
so we theoritically can start working on this individual chunks without 
having to wait for the full request being read

if a file being uploaded the file will take considerably longer and therefore streaming 
that data could make sense because it could allow you to start writing on disk where your 
app runs (the server) whilst the data is coming in. So you don't have to parse the 
entire file which will take sometime to be fully uploaded

you need to use buffer to organize these chunks
