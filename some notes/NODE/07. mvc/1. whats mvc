making sure that different parts of your code do different things 
and know which part is responsible for what

models ->   objects / part of your code that represents the data in your code 
            and allowing you to work with it
                - saving data
                - fetching data
                - deleting data

views ->    responsible for what the user see, responsible for rendering the right 
            content to the users

controller -> connecting models and views, the in-between logic
