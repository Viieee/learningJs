we will be using movie rental database as the example to make explaining the concept easier

drivers license table:
driverId => primary key
first_name
last_name
address
postcode
date_of_birth
expiry_date
license_class
driver_image

member table:
memberId => primary key
surname
first_name
address
phone_no
email
dob
bank_details
driverId => foreign key 

rental table:
rentalId => primary key
memberId => foreign key
rental_date
rental_expiry
total_price

movie table:
movieId => primary table
movie_name
distributor
director
genre
rating
year_of_release
rental_cost
rental_duration

movie_rental table (junction):
rentalId => foreign key
movieId => foreign key

- one to one, relation where one record in table A associate with a record in table B
    example:
    relation between drivers license table and member table,
    every one driver license is used to identify one member 
        and one member id identified with one driver license id
- one to many, relation where one record in table A associate with one or more record in table B
    example:
    relation between member table and rental table,
    one member can make many rentals but every rental only relates to one member
- many to many, relation where records from both table can be many 
    example:
    relation between rental and movie,
    one movie can be in many rental and one rental can contain many movies
  in order to do this you need a junction table to connect both tables
