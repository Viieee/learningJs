stands for structured query language 
query are crucial in this database type
queries are commands we use to interact with the database

sql database thinks in so called tables 
example: 
    users table, 
    products table, 
    orders table

in each table you have fields/columns 
example:
    in users table you have
        id, email, name 
    in product table you have
        id, title, price, description

we are filling those fields with rows of data, and we call it records

sql database allow you to relate different tables,
example:
    an order could simply be described as a connection of a user and a product,
    because a user could order a couple of different products and 
        a product could be ordered by a couple of different users

characteristics of sql database:
- strong data schema, for each table we clearly define how the data in there should look like
    which fields do we have? which type of data does each fields store?
    so we have strong and strictly defined schema and all data in the table has to 
    fit the schema
- data relations, relating different table with basically three important kinds of relations:
    one to one, one to many, and many to many. 
        this simply means that we can have two tables where each records fits one other record, 
        a record might fit multiple other records or 
        multiple records in table A can fit multiple records in table B
    in other words the tables are connected
