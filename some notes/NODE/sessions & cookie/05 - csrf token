npm install --save csurf

csrf stands for cross site request forgery
it's a special kind of attack pattern where people can abuse your session and trick users of your application to execute malicious code

user will be directed to fake site that lookin like your website
on the fake site there could be a link leading to your page executing some request
so the request the user want might be to send some money to b and instead it will sent to c 

it can be protected by making sure that people can only use session in your site when they are working with views rendered by your page
you need csrf token for this

csurf is the package to help us generate these tokens,
basically a token (string value) we can embed into our pages for every request that does somenthing on the backend that changes the user's state
so anything sensitive which we want to protect we can do it this way.
we can include the token in our views, and on the server this package will check if the incoming request does have that valid token.
how this protect us?
the fake sites might send request to your backend and theoretically use your session but the request will be missing the token and they can't guess the token 
because it's a random hashed value and the package in the server will determined whether the token is valid or not so the attacker can't guess it and they
also can't steal it because a new token is generated for every page you render 

note:
the name in the hidden input tag -HAS TO BE- _csrf
