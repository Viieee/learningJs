mvc is all about separation of concerns,
making sure that different part of your code do different things and you clearly understand
which part of your code is responsible for what

stands for model view controller
models represent your data in your code, allows you to work with your data 
    (saving data, fetching data (to or from a file/memory))
views responsible for what the users see in the end, so they are responsible for
    rendering the right content in our html documents and sending that back to the user
controller are the connection point between the models and the views
