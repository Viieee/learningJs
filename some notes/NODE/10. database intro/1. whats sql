sql stands for structured query language

sql use tables

a table can contain some fields/columns and each of these fields have their own rule to be filled

the price field is the field that should be filled with a number/integer data type and should be used to store data for prices

the data on each row is called records

an order table is basically a relation between the customers table and the products table

theres a few different type of relations in sql:
1. one to one
