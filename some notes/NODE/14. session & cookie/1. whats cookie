cookie is a file send by websites to recognize user that connected to their servers

http is a stateless protocol, 
which means they will only send a response back to a request the user made and thats it
cookie is a way for the web to remember the user even after we send different request
and the data we use to remember the user in their currently used browser doesn't affect the other users
