Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), 
the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

As name suggests it comes in middle of something and that is request and response cycle

example:

app.use((req, res, next)=>{
    console.log('In the middleware');
    next(); -> required to execute the other middleware after it
});

app.use((req, res, next)=>{
    console.log('another middleware');
});
