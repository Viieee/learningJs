1. local state,
    state that belongs to one component
    example: listening to an input field
    should be managed in component internal using useState/useReducer
2. cross component state,
    state that affects multiple components
    example: open/close state of a modal overlay
    handled using prop chains/prop drilling
3. app wide state
    state that affects the entire app
    example: authentication status
    handled using context / redux / prop drilling / prop chains

we want to use redux over context when:
1. the app is more complex, when using context can lead to nested jsx code with the providers
2. the state being watched is changing on high frequency
