redux is about having one central data state store that can be shared across the app
in this store you can store a lot of different data state
example: authentication status, theming, user input state

few components of redux:
1. the data state store
2. component that uses the state stored in the redux store using subscription 
3. reducer function, function that will process/transform the data state stored in the redux store
4. action that triggered by the component using dispatch

component subscribed to the redux store 
component trigger action using dispatch
this action then forwarded to the reducer function
reducer function then changes the data stored in the redux store
this changes reflected in the components that subscribed to the redux store
