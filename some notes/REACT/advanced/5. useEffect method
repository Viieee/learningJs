useEffect function is a function that will only be executed after every evaluation if 
the dependency (the second argument of this function) changed
the dependency is an optional argument

useEffect(()=>{...}, [dependencies])

if the dependency is an empty array then the function will only run once and thats when the app start
if theres no dependency then the function will be triggered everytime the component runs
